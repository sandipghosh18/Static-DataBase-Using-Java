In this repository I am going to design an Static Database of student using collection Framework in java.

## Name of the DataBase------> Student_Informations
Attributes of our db are:
* Student Id (Primary Key)
* Student Name
* Student Department
* Student Email
## Operation inside the DB
* Insertion of new student
* Update of an old Student info
* Deletion of an information
* read an information from db
